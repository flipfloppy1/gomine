# gomine
A Minesweeper project that I'm using to learn Go.

## Building
First, [install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Then simply clone the repo and run `go build` in the repository root.

## Using
Use the arrow keys or h,j,k,l to navigate the menu, press enter to make choices. While in the game, press "c" and "m" to `CLEAR` or `MARK` plots, which will switch you between modes, allowing you to clear or mark subsequent plots by pressing enter or space. The game supports vim-like navigation with arrow keys and numbers + h,j,k,l.
