# gomine
A Minesweeper project that I'm using to learn Go.

## Building
First, [install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Then simply clone the repo and run `go build` in the repository root.

## Using
Use the arrow keys or h,j,k,l to navigate the menu, press enter to make choices. While in the game, press "c" and "m" to change between `CLEAR` and `MARK` modes. In `CLEAR` mode, press enter or space to clear plots of land. In `MARK` mode, do the same to mark a dangerous plot with an exclamation point. The game supports vim-like navigation with arrow keys and h,j,k,l.
